        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I'm Anthony, the owner of Montana Stone Masonry, LLC. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. My dad was and is still one of the hardest working stonemasons I know. He instilled in me the worth of working hard and providing the best work possible for his customers. I watched him build a successful business and knew one day I would hope to do the same. I started laboring for him as a teenager and was gradually taught the tricks of the trade that his uncles had once taught him.
        </p>
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          After graduating high school, I attended the Pennsylvania College of Technology to learn all things masonry. This has allowed me to branch out into all the different facets of masonry.
        </p>

      <h4>How did I end up in Montana?</h4>
      <p>
        My whole family has always loved the mountains. We started making trips out west when I was a boy. I said from a very early age that one day I would move to Montana. For many years I worked in Philadelphia and surroundings counties and found myself yearning for a different way of living. The mountains were calling. The opportunity presented itself to follow my dream and I did not hesitate to go for it. I started to work for Scott Koelzer Masonry in the spring of 2015. The opportunity to work for such an established company was amazing. I was surprised to discover how much I had to learn. This territory has a completely different stone outlook from what I was accustom to back east. They were and are still incredible mentors and I am forever grateful for their guidance.
      </p>
      <h4>Why open your own business in Montana?</h4>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, I watched my dad build a business from nothing, I have always had the respect of someone who could succeed in the way he did. My own desire to do so too is abundant especially now that I have started my own family. Maybe we're crazy? All I know is I want to give my family the best I can and feel this is the best way to achieve that dream.
      </p>
      <h4>What are your goals?</h4>
      <p>
        My goal is to provide Bozeman and surrounding areas with the highest quality of masonry work. I am professional, prompt and reliable and will do everything in my power to provide top notch services to each and every one of my customers.
